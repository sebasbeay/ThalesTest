There is no major issue since I did not install any strange or potentially problematic libraries.

The frontend part was created in the Index view of the HomeController, so you just need to execute that action to see the required textbox and button.

The API can sometimes become congested and retrieving information can be tedious. To manage this situation, I created an alert that notifies when the server is too busy.

I tried to do my best with my knowledge and skills.

Thanks for the opportunity :)
