There is no major issue since I did not install any strange or potentially problematic libraries.

The API can sometimes become congested and retrieving information can be tedious. To manage this situation, I created an alert that notifies when the server is too busy.

I tried to do my best with my knowledge and skills.

Thanks for the opportunity :)
